# App-Opener-3000
GUI That allows the user to open multiple apps, select them, and manipulate the data inside the GUI. Using TKinter and Python 3
***Do not delete the save.txt file - this is how the program knows what you previously selected for apps!***

Thank you for checking out my App Opener!
This was my first ever "big" project using Python.

The idea here is that when you launch the app, you get to choose up to 4 different apps on you mac to open. Choices are stored in a local .txt file that upon re-open of the app, your slection are saved! You can clear all and start over. 

Some integration:
- Duplicate apps can't be chosen, the program will detect it and wont let you do that.
- Pictures are manually assigned.. Which means if you choose an app, instead of a picture, it will populate with the files location instead
- Dir are optomized for MacOS, windows should work but I have never tested it, so buyers beware.


Ideas for future:
- Maybe add a remove single app option where you can choose the app you want to remove instead of a clear all button.
- I'd like to have the pictures pulled and added through stricly file location rather than ad call function.
- If you have any ideas that you'd like to see let me know! @AnthonyTerrano
